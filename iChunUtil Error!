When I put the file into the Mod folder and start Minecraft an error comes up and says:
Forge Mod Loader has found a probkem with your Minecraft installation.
The mods and versions listed below could not be found.
Forge: minimum version required is 10.13.0.1186.
The file "Forgemodloader-client-0.log" contains more information.
Please help! This only happens when I install iChunUtil!

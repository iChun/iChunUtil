By downloading and/or using iChunUtil ("Mod"), you hereby permit the Mod and any software which has a hard dependency ("Child Mods") on the Mod to use your internet connection to request non-malicious information/content from third-party sources such as Github.com or Creeperhost.net. You also permit, but may opt out of in the configuration file, the Mod to collect and use, your Minecraft Account UUID (This cannot be used to access your Mojang Account, but will permit us to retrieve your Minecraft Skin and Name) which will not be publicly disclosed, your IP address which will not be publicly disclosed (for approximate geoip purposes, accurate up to possibly state level. We would have this information if you visited a website anyways), as well as several non-identifying information on other Child Mods and other Mod-related statistics.

You accept that the Mod is provided without warranty; software support will be given where possible. You will also not hold iChun ("Author") and other official contributors liable for any damage or harm caused to your machinery, self or any objects/biological beings around you. Contributions by the official contributors will be thoroughly screened/managed by the Author to ensure it is working as intended by the Author without any malicious intent. If any damage or harm has indeed been pinpointed to the Mod as the cause, this is completely unintentional and the issue in the Mod will be fixed/resolved as soon as possible.

You understand that any downloads of the Mod not originating from iChun.us ("Website") leading to the Website's File Host, CreeperHost, may be modified without knowledge of the Author and may be malicious, and will not hold the Author responsible. In the event that any downloads originating from the Website are indeed malicious, it is entirely unintentional and will be rectified once the Author has been notified.

You accept that if you are redistributing the Mod to other users without their agreement of this EULA and they were to use the Mod, you therefore hold yourself accountable for any conflict or problem that occurs and will be held responsible. This includes but is not limited to any of the other users disagreeing to any data collection done by the Mod.

You accept that the EULA may change at any time without prior notice. However, the EULA will never change to allow The Mod and Author to intentionally introduce malicious content to your system.
